        <p>Before we go any further: Yes, the TicWatch Pro 3 with LTE features the same design and specs as the TicWatch Pro 3 GPS. The only difference, of course, is the addition of LTE band support, which will allow users to easily connect to the Internet when on the go. That seems like a minuscule addition, but it could let you ditch your smartphone when going on an outdoor adventure.<br><br>

            Without LTE, if you leave your phone behind, your smartwatch is simply a traditional timepiece. Add LTE to the equation, and you can leave your phone behind and still take phone calls, navigate, and more. It’s a freeing experience when your smartwatch no longer has to rely on your phone. Importantly, you can send out SOS alerts with just your watch — no phone needed.</p>
